# programapi

This project downloads, processes, saves, and serves the static JSON files containing details of accepted speakers and submissions via an API.

What this project does step-by-step:

1. Downloads the Pretalx speaker and submission data, and saves it as JSON files.
2. Transforms the JSON files into a format that is easier to work with and OK to serve publicly. This includes removing unnecessary/private fields, and adding new fields.
3. Serves the JSON files via an API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependency management tool: ``make deps/pre``
3. Install the dependencies: ``make deps/install``
4. Set up ``pre-commit``: ``make pre-commit``

## Usage

- Run the whole process: ``make all``
- Run only the download process: ``make download``
- Run only the transformation process: ``make transform``

**Note:** Don't forget to set the ``PRETALX_TOKEN`` environment variable before running the download process. And please don't make too many requests to the Pretalx API, it might get angry ðŸ¤ª

## API

The API is served at ``programapi24.europython.eu/2024``. It has two endpoints (for now):

- ``/speakers.json``: Returns the list of confirmed speakers.
- ``/sessions.json``: Returns the list of confirmed sessions.

**Note:** See [this page](data/examples/README.md) for the explanations of the fields in the returned JSON files.
